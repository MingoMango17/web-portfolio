          As a passionate Full Stack Developer currently pursuing my Bachelor's
          in Computer Science at the University of the Philippines Cebu, I
          combine academic knowledge with hands-on industry experience to build
          efficient, user-centered applications.

          My development journey began as an intern at HQZen/BPOseats, where I
          built a full-stack kanban board application using Vue.js and Django.
          This experience laid the foundation for my understanding of the entire
          development lifecycle and collaborative workflows using Git.

        <p className="text-white text-justify text-center max-w-200">
          My interests in video games, emerging technologies, and automotive
          engineering inspire my approach to developmentâ€”I believe in creating
          solutions that are not just functional, but engaging and
          forward-thinking. I'm constantly learning and expanding my skillset,
          always ready to tackle the next challenge with enthusiasm and
          dedication.
